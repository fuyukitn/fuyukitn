## Public Code Projects
**Apartments Plus**  
A Django-based civic tech app that aggregates overlooked information in Chicago’s rental market—such as landlord reputations and proximity to essential amenities—to support informed housing decisions. My contribution was data modeling, pipelines (Airflow), and Docker setup.

**Policy Pulse**   
Scalable NLP pipeline for analyzing U.S. state legislative trends using Spark-based topic modeling and large-scale text data. Built an end-to-end distributed pipeline (AWS, Spark, Dask) to process 100k+ state bills and track policy topics over time and across states.
